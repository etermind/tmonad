# Contributing

If you want to contribute, you can send a pull request provided that:

1. The linter passes without modifying the rules (npm run lint);
2. The documentation is updated; 
3. You follow the [Conventional commit convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/);
4. You keep the coverage of the tests very high (at least 90%) (npm run test);
5. The code is clean;
6. And the library builds (npm run build).

We really like to keep this library minimalistic and easy-to-use.
